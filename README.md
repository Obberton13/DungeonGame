# DungeonGame

DungeonGame is a Roguelike Dungeon game that I am going to be making in my free time. It is inspired by a similar game I had to make for one of my classes, which you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/Obberton13/ComS229-Roguelike_Dungeon). However, there will be several differences to that project, including the following:
* This project will be entirely in C++. The previous one I started in C, and moved to C++ later.
* Many imporovements to the pathfinding system, including the ability to detect line-of-sight, among other things.
* The parsed monster and item files will be in the same path as the executable, instead of the user's home directory.
	* Maybe a second program could be used to validate a user's monster/item files?
* There will be no saving and loading. When you load the game, you load a new game. When you leave the game, you sacrifice your progress.
	* However, being able to record every move would be cool.
* Being able to use the mouse would be nice, but I have no idea how.
* I will have different controls from the previous one.
* The levels that I have to start off with will probably be super-simple, using the same level generation method I used in the previous project. Once I get more into it, they will get more complex, maybe bigger than they are now. Infinitely generating maybe? Sounds fun.
* The player will not be able to dig.

## The Title

I haven't really come up with one. DungeonGame is probably a bit too generic, right? Comment in the [Game Name](https://github.com/Obberton13/DungeonGame/issues/1) issue if you have an idea.

## Feature Requests

Feel free to create an issue and suggest something if you would like it to be added. Keep in mind that I have sole discretion over whether it will actually be added or not.

## Streaming

I will probably be streaming most of the development of this on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/obberton13). Feel free to drop by.
